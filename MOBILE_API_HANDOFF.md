# OpenVision mobile app — API handoff for the Flutter developer

Version 0.1 · 29.10.2026 · backend: `cloud_api/` in this repo

This is everything you need to start the client app. The backend is built and
tested; you can run it on your laptop with fake data and build against it
today, without cameras or a GPU. Where something is not built yet it says
**Planned** — don't build UI for it yet, or build it behind a flag.

---

## 1. What the app is

OpenVision is a cloud video-analytics service. A company signs up, connects
its CCTV cameras, our GPU servers analyse the video (people, faces), and the
company sees the results in the app: which cameras are working, what was
detected, when, on which camera, with a snapshot.

The app is one client of a REST + WebSocket API. There is no mobile-specific
backend; a web dashboard will use the same API.

**MVP scope for the app:**

1. Sign up / sign in / sign out, staying signed in across restarts
2. Dashboard: today's counts, cameras online, a per-hour chart
3. Camera list with live status, and *why* a camera is not working
4. Add a camera (three ways, §7), rename, switch on/off, delete
5. Event feed: newest first, infinite scroll, filter by camera / known / time
6. Event detail: face crop, full frame with the box drawn, time, camera
7. Live: new events and camera status changes arrive without refreshing
8. Team (admins only): list users, invite with a role, change role, remove
9. Register the device for push notifications (the sending side is Planned)

---

## 2. Run the backend locally

You need Docker. From the repo root:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.demo.yml up --build
```

That starts Postgres, Redis, the API on **http://localhost:8000**, and a
simulator that creates a fake event every few seconds, in the same format the
real GPU pipeline produces. On first start it creates a demo account:

| email | password | role |
|---|---|---|
| `demo@openvision.dev` | `demo-password-1` | owner (can do everything) |
| `viewer@openvision.dev` | `demo-password-1` | viewer (read-only) |

The demo account has three cameras: two online, one offline (so you can see
both states), and new events keep arriving on the online ones.

- Interactive API docs (try every call in the browser): http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- OpenAPI JSON (for code generation if you want it): http://localhost:8000/api/openapi.json

**From a phone or emulator**, `localhost` is the device itself:

- Android emulator: use `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
- Real device on the same Wi-Fi: use your laptop's IP, e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:8000`

Image URLs in responses are built from `OV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. Set it to the
address your device uses, or images will point at `localhost`:

```bash
OV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000 docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.demo.yml up
```

To wipe everything and start over:
`docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.demo.yml down -v`.

## 3. Conventions

| | |
|---|---|
| Base path | `/api/v1` |
| Format | JSON, UTF-8, `Content-Type: application/json` |
| Auth | `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on every call except register / login / refresh / logout |
| Times | ISO 8601 in UTC, e.g. `2026-10-29T08:15:30Z`. Convert to local time for display; send UTC in query params |
| IDs | users, tenants, events, edge agents: UUID strings. **Cameras: integers** |
| Unknown fields | Ignore them. We add fields without bumping the version; we don't remove or rename them without one |
| Nulls | Any field typed `X \| null` below can be `null`; handle it |

### Errors

Every error has the same shape, whatever the status code:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "camera_limit_reached",
    "message": "your plan allows 4 cameras",
    "details": { "limit": 4 }
  }
}
```

**Branch on `code`, never on `message`.** `message` is English, for logs and
for developers. Write your own user-facing text per `code` (the app will need
Russian and Kazakh). `details` is `null` or an object whose shape depends on
the code. The full list of codes is in §11.

Validation errors (422, `validation_error`) list the fields:

```json
{"error": {"code": "validation_error", "message": "request is invalid",
  "details": [{"field": "password", "message": "String should have at least 10 characters"}]}}
```

`field` matches the JSON key, so you can show the message under the matching form field.

### Pagination

Lists that grow without limit (events, audit) use cursors:

```
GET /api/v1/events?limit=50
→ {"items": [...], "next_cursor": "MjAyNi0xMC0yOVQw..."}

GET /api/v1/events?limit=50&cursor=MjAyNi0xMC0yOVQw...
→ {"items": [...], "next_cursor": null}        ← null = last page
```

The cursor is opaque: don't parse it or build one yourself. Keep the other
filters unchanged while you page. Small lists (cameras, users, edge agents)
are plain arrays with no paging.

---

## 4. Authentication

### Tokens

- **access_token**: a JWT valid for 15 minutes (`expires_in: 900`). Send it as a Bearer token.
- **refresh_token**: an opaque string valid for 30 days. Use it only to get a new pair.

Store both in **`flutter_secure_storage`** (Keychain / Keystore), never in
SharedPreferences. Don't decode the JWT to make decisions; use `GET /auth/me`.

### Calls

**Sign up** creates the company and its owner, and signs them in:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/register
{"company_name": "Acme LLP", "full_name": "Aida S.", "email": "aida@acme.kz",
 "password": "at-least-10-chars", "device_name": "Pixel 8"}
→ 201 {"access_token": "...", "refresh_token": "ovr_...", "token_type": "bearer", "expires_in": 900}
```

Errors: `email_taken` (409), `validation_error` (422). The password needs 10 to 128 characters.
`device_name` is optional; it will be shown in a future "active sessions" list.

**Sign in**:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/login
{"email": "aida@acme.kz", "password": "...", "device_name": "Pixel 8"}
→ 200 same body as register
```

Errors: `invalid_credentials` (401) for both a wrong password and an unknown
email (deliberately the same), `account_suspended` (403), and `rate_limited`
(429, after 5 tries a minute, with `details.retry_after` in seconds).

**Refresh**:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
{"refresh_token": "ovr_..."}
→ 200 new pair; the old refresh token is now dead
```

Error: `invalid_refresh_token` (401). Clear the stored tokens and go to sign in.

**Sign out**:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/logout
{"refresh_token": "ovr_..."}
→ 204
```

Clear local tokens whatever the response.

**Who am I** — call it after sign in and on app start:

```
GET /api/v1/auth/me
→ 200
{
  "user":   {"id": "uuid", "email": "aida@acme.kz", "full_name": "Aida S.", "role": "owner",
             "is_active": true, "created_at": "...", "last_login_at": "..."},
  "tenant": {"id": "uuid", "name": "Acme LLP", "plan": "face", "max_cameras": 4, "retention_days": 30},
  "permissions": ["account.write", "audit.read", "cameras.control", "cameras.read",
                  "cameras.write", "events.read", "users.read", "users.write"]
}
```

**Change password** (signs out every other session):

```
PUT /api/v1/auth/me/password
{"current_password": "...", "new_password": "..."}
→ 204          errors: wrong_password (400), validation_error (422)
```

After this the stored refresh token no longer works. Sign the user in again with the new password.

### ⚠️ Refresh rotation: the one thing to get right

Refresh tokens are **single-use**. If the same refresh token is presented
twice, the server assumes it was stolen and **revokes the whole session**:
both requests get 401, and the user is signed out.

The common way to trigger this by accident: the access token expires, three
requests fail with 401 at the same moment, and each one calls `/auth/refresh`
on its own. So:

1. **Only one refresh at a time.** In your Dio interceptor (or equivalent),
   keep a single `Future<TokenPair>?` for the refresh in flight. Every 401
   awaits that future and then retries its request once with the new token.
2. **Save the new pair before retrying anything.** If the app dies between
   receiving the new pair and saving it, the user has to sign in again.
3. Refresh **proactively** when `expires_in` is nearly used up (say 60 s
   left), and on app resume, so most requests never see a 401.
4. A 401 from `/auth/refresh` itself means sign out. Don't retry it.

### Roles and permissions

Drive the UI from `permissions` in `/me`, not from `role`. The table below is
what the server enforces:

| permission | viewer | operator | admin | owner | what it unlocks |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| `cameras.read` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | camera list and detail |
| `events.read` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | events, stats, live |
| `cameras.control` | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | switch a camera on/off |
| `cameras.write` | | | ✓ | ✓ | add / edit / delete cameras, edge agents |
| `users.read` / `users.write` | | | ✓ | ✓ | team screen |
| `audit.read` | | | ✓ | ✓ | security log |
| `account.write` | | | | ✓ | company settings (Planned) |

A call without the permission returns 403 `forbidden`. If a role changes
while the user is signed in, it takes effect on their next request, so
re-fetch `/me` when you get an unexpected 403.

## 5. Cameras

### The camera object

```json
{
  "id": 17,
  "name": "Entrance",
  "location": "Main door",
  "mode": "pull",
  "source_url": "rtsp://***@cam.example.com:554/Streaming/Channels/101",
  "edge_agent_id": null,
  "enabled": true,
  "status": "online",
  "status_reason": null,
  "stream_info": {"codec": "h264", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "fps": 25.0},
  "last_seen_at": "2026-10-29T08:15:00Z",
  "last_event_at": "2026-10-29T08:14:41Z",
  "created_at": "2026-10-20T10:00:00Z"
}
```

`source_url` always has the password removed. The real URL is never sent to
the app, after it has been saved.

### Status and reason: what to show the user

`status` is the badge colour; `status_reason` explains it. **Showing the
reason is what keeps a broken camera from becoming a support call**, so give
every reason its own sentence. Suggested wording:

| status | meaning | badge |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | just saved, setting up (a few seconds) | grey, spinner |
| `connecting` | set up, no video yet | amber, spinner |
| `online` | video arriving and being analysed | green |
| `offline` | was working, video stopped | red |
| `error` | can't work until the client fixes something | red |
| `disabled` | switched off by the client | grey |

| status_reason | suggested text |
|---|---|
| `null` | (nothing to explain) |
| `waiting_for_video` | "Waiting for video. Check that your recorder is sending the stream to the address we gave you." |
| `edge_agent_offline` | "The OpenVision box at your site is offline. Check that it is powered on and connected to the internet." |
| `no_video` | "Video stopped arriving. Check the camera's power and network." (also show `last_seen_at`: "last seen 3 h ago") |
| `waiting_for_gpu` | "Video is fine, waiting for analysis capacity. No action needed." (our problem, not theirs) |
| `source_unreachable` | "We can't reach this camera. Check the address and that it is reachable from the internet." |
| `source_auth_failed` | "The camera refused the username or password." |
| `source_not_found` | "The camera has no stream at this path. Check the URL." |
| `unsupported_codec` | "This camera sends video in a format we can't analyse (we need H.264 or H.265). Change it in the camera's settings." |
| `no_video_track` | "The stream has no video." |
| `private_address_refused` | "This is a local network address, so we can't reach it from the cloud. Use an OpenVision box (edge agent) instead." |
| `ingest_error` | "Something went wrong on our side. We've been notified." |

New reasons may appear later. For an unknown reason, show the status badge
with a generic "Not working, contact support" and log the code.

### Calls

```
GET    /api/v1/cameras                     → [camera, ...]            cameras.read
GET    /api/v1/cameras/{id}                → camera                   cameras.read
POST   /api/v1/cameras/probe               → probe result             cameras.write
POST   /api/v1/cameras                     → 201 camera (+ push)      cameras.write
PATCH  /api/v1/cameras/{id}                → camera                   see below
POST   /api/v1/cameras/{id}/rotate-key     → push credentials         cameras.write
DELETE /api/v1/cameras/{id}                → 204                      cameras.write
```

**PATCH** takes any subset of `{"name", "location", "enabled", "source_url"}`.
A body with only `enabled` needs `cameras.control` (operators can do it);
anything else needs `cameras.write`. Changing `source_url` re-runs the check
in §7.1 and can fail the same way.

**DELETE** removes the camera from the API immediately. Ingest, analysis and
its events are removed in the background.

Errors: `not_found` (404; also for another company's camera id),
`camera_limit_reached` (409, `details.limit`), `probe_failed` (422, §7.1).

## 6. Events

### The event object

```json
{
  "id": "6f1c0c2e-6a55-4b8e-9d1a-3a8f0b9e7c11",
  "camera_id": 17,
  "camera_name": "Entrance",
  "kind": "face",
  "occurred_at": "2026-10-29T08:15:30Z",
  "person_id": "0d6c2f1e-1111-2222-3333-444455556666",
  "is_known": true,
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "bbox": [640, 220, 96, 120],
  "crop_url": "https://api.../api/v1/media/eyJ...",
  "frame_url": "https://api.../api/v1/media/eyJ...",
  "media_expires_at": "2026-10-29T08:25:30Z",
  "attributes": null
}
```

- `kind`: currently always `"face"`. Body / line-crossing events will add
  more kinds; show unknown kinds with a generic icon and don't crash.
- `person_id`: a stable id for the same person across events. Unknown people
  get an id too, so "seen 4 times today" works for them as well. Known
  people's names are Planned (§10).
- `is_known`: matched someone in the company's people list.
- `confidence`: 0–1, `null` for unknown people. Show it as a percentage at most; don't make users read it.
- `bbox`: `[x, y, width, height]` in **pixels of the full frame**. To draw it
  on the image, scale it by displayed size ÷ the image's natural size.
- `attributes`: reserved for clothing / gender / age, `null` for now.

### Images: URLs expire

`crop_url` and `frame_url` are **signed URLs that stop working at
`media_expires_at`** (10 minutes). They need no auth header, so
`Image.network` / `CachedNetworkImage` works directly. But:

- **Cache by event id, not by URL.** With `cached_network_image`, set
  `cacheKey: '${event.id}_crop'`. The URL changes on every fetch; the image does not.
- If an image fails to load with 403 (`media_link_expired`), re-fetch that
  event with `GET /events/{id}` to get fresh URLs. Don't retry the old URL.
- Either URL can be `null` (no image kept for that event); show a placeholder.

### Calls

```
GET /api/v1/events                       events.read
    ?camera_id=17&camera_id=18           repeat the key for several cameras
    &known=true|false
    &person_id=...                       everything about one person
    &kind=face
    &since=2026-10-29T00:00:00Z          inclusive
    &until=2026-10-30T00:00:00Z          exclusive
    &limit=50                            1..200, default 50
    &cursor=...
  → {"items": [event, ...], "next_cursor": "..." | null}       newest first

GET /api/v1/events/{id}                  → event
```

### Dashboard numbers

```
GET /api/v1/stats/summary?since=...&until=...       events.read
    defaults: the last 24 hours; at most 31 days between since and until
→ {
  "since": "...", "until": "...",
  "total_events": 312, "known_events": 40, "unique_people": 118,
  "cameras_online": 2, "cameras_total": 3,
  "by_camera": [{"camera_id": 17, "camera_name": "Entrance", "events": 200, "known": 30}],
  "by_hour":   [{"start": "2026-10-29T08:00:00Z", "events": 41}]
}
```

`by_hour` leaves out hours with no events; fill the gaps with zero when you
draw the chart. Hours are UTC hours: for Kazakhstan (UTC+5) they still line
up with local hours, because the offset is a whole number of hours. Error:
`invalid_range` (422).

---

## 7. Adding a camera: three ways

The first screen of "Add camera" should ask *how* the camera is reachable,
because the answer changes the whole flow:

| mode | the user's situation | what they give us |
|---|---|---|
| `pull` | "My camera/recorder has an internet address" (public IP, cloud NVR) | an `rtsp://` URL |
| `push` | "My recorder/VMS can send a stream" (Hikvision / Dahua / Milestone / ffmpeg) | nothing; **we** give them an address |
| `edge` | "My cameras are only on our local network" (most customers) | the camera's local URL + which OpenVision box reads it |

Guide the user to the right one. A short questionnaire is usually better than
naming the three modes.

### 7.1 Pull

1. The user enters the URL, e.g. `rtsp://admin:pass@203.0.113.5:554/Streaming/Channels/101`.
2. Optional but recommended: test it first, without saving:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/cameras/probe   {"url": "rtsp://..."}
   → 200 {"ok": true, "reason": null,
          "stream": {"codec": "h264", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "fps": 25.0},
          "warnings": ["low_fps"]}
   ```
   This always returns 200; read `ok`. It can take **up to ~12 s**, so show a
   spinner with a "Connecting to your camera…" label. If `ok`, show "1920×1080,
   25 fps, H.264 ✓". Warnings (`low_fps` under 10 fps, `low_resolution` under
   480p) mean the camera works but results will be worse. Show them, but
   allow saving. If not `ok`, show the text for `reason` from §5.
3. Save:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/cameras   {"name": "Entrance", "location": "Main door", "mode": "pull", "source_url": "rtsp://..."}
   ```
   The server probes again and refuses to save a URL that doesn't work:
   ```
   422 {"error": {"code": "probe_failed", "message": "...",
                  "details": {"reason": "source_auth_failed", "stream": null}}}
   ```

A local address (`192.168.*`, `10.*`, `127.*` …) is always refused with
`private_address_refused`. Offer the edge flow instead.

### 7.2 Push

1. `POST /api/v1/cameras {"name": "Checkout", "mode": "push"}`
2. The response has a `push` object, **only this once**:
   ```json
   "push": {
     "srt_url":  "srt://ingest.openvision.kz:8890?streamid=publish:cam/18:push:ovk_...&pkt_size=1316",
     "rtsp_url": "rtsp://push:ovk_...@ingest.openvision.kz:8554/cam/18",
     "stream_key": "ovk_..."
   }
   ```
3. Show both URLs with copy buttons and a "Share" action. They're long, so
   don't make anyone retype them. Say that SRT is preferred and RTSP is the
   fallback. Warn that it won't be shown again.
4. The camera stays `connecting` / `waiting_for_video` until video arrives,
   then turns `online`. Watch it over the WebSocket (§8) on the same screen,
   so the user sees it go green while still at their recorder.
5. If they lose the key: `POST /cameras/{id}/rotate-key` returns a new `push`
   object, and the old key stops working.

Treat these URLs like passwords: no analytics events, no crash-report breadcrumbs.

### 7.3 Edge (OpenVision box on the customer's LAN)

An *edge agent* is a small program (a Docker container or a mini-PC we ship)
on the customer's network. It reads their cameras locally and sends the video
to us; nothing on their network is opened to the internet. One agent serves
all the cameras at a site.

1. List agents: `GET /api/v1/edge-agents` → `[{"id", "name", "online", "last_seen_at", "created_at"}]`
2. If there is none, create one: `POST /api/v1/edge-agents {"name": "Warehouse PC"}` →
   `201 {..., "token": "ova_...", "install_command": "docker run -d ..."}`.
   The token and command are shown **once**. Show the command with a copy
   button. Typically an IT person runs it, so offer "Share / send by email".
   `online` turns true within ~30 s of the agent starting.
3. Add the camera with its **local** URL:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/cameras
   {"name": "Loading bay", "mode": "edge", "edge_agent_id": "<agent uuid>",
    "source_url": "rtsp://admin:pass@192.168.1.64:554/stream1"}
   ```
   There's no probe for edge cameras: we can't reach their LAN. The camera
   shows `edge_agent_offline` until the agent connects, then
   `waiting_for_video`, then `online`.
4. `DELETE /api/v1/edge-agents/{id}` removes an agent and switches off its cameras.

---

## 8. Live updates (WebSocket)

```
wss://<host>/api/v1/live            (ws:// for the local demo)
```

Use `web_socket_channel`. The token goes **in the first message, not in the
URL** (URLs end up in proxy logs).

```
→ {"type": "auth", "token": "<access token>"}          within 10 s of connecting
← {"type": "ready", "data": {"expires_at": 1793270000}}  unix seconds

← {"type": "event",          "data": <event object, §6>}
← {"type": "camera_status",  "data": <camera object, §5>}   on any status change, and on create / edit
← {"type": "camera_deleted", "data": {"id": 17}}
← {"type": "ping"}                                      every 25 s; nothing to answer

→ {"type": "subscribe", "camera_ids": [17, 18]}        only these cameras' events; null = all (default)
→ {"type": "auth", "token": "<new access token>"}      after each token refresh; you get a new "ready"
```

The server closes the socket with:

- **4401**: no auth, a bad token, or the token expired without a new `auth`
  frame. Refresh tokens (§4) and reconnect.
- **4403**: the role can't read events.

**Reconnecting.** Mobile networks drop sockets all the time. On any close
other than 4403, reconnect with backoff (1 s, 2 s, 4 s … capped at 30 s; reset
after a stable minute). Also reconnect on app resume. Treat 60 s without any
frame (pings come every 25 s) as a dead connection.

**Live messages are best effort.** Messages sent while you were disconnected
are not replayed. After every (re)connect, re-fetch `GET /cameras` and the
first page of `GET /events` and merge by id. The socket is for freshness; REST
is the source of truth. Event `id`s are unique, so de-duplicate on them.

Keep the socket open only while the app is in the foreground. Background
alerts are push notifications' job (§9).

---

## 9. Push notifications

Register the device after sign in, and again whenever FCM gives you a new token:

```
POST   /api/v1/devices   {"platform": "android" | "ios" | "web", "push_token": "<FCM token>"}
→ 201 {"id": "uuid", "platform": "android", "created_at": "..."}

DELETE /api/v1/devices/{id}  → 204        on sign out, before clearing tokens
```

Registering is idempotent: the same token registered again replaces the old
row, even if it belonged to another user on a shared phone.

**Planned:** the server doesn't send pushes yet; it needs our Firebase
project, which you'll get separately. Use Firebase Cloud Messaging on both
platforms (APNs through FCM). The planned payload is a data message
`{"type": "event", "event_id": "...", "camera_id": "17"}` with a notification
title and body. On tap, open `GET /events/{event_id}`.

## 10. Not built yet

So you don't build against things that don't exist:

| feature | state |
|---|---|
| People list (upload a photo, name a person, `is_known` → name) | **Planned.** Events already carry `person_id`; names will come from a `/persons` API |
| Live video / camera snapshot in the app | **Planned.** For now show the last event's frame as the camera's thumbnail |
| Push sending | **Planned** (§9); device registration works now |
| Forgot password / email verification | **Planned.** Hide "Forgot password?" for now, or open a support contact |
| Company settings, plan / billing | **Planned** (`account.write`) |
| Active sessions list ("sign out other devices") | **Planned.** Changing the password already signs out everything else |
| Event acknowledgement / notes | Not planned yet; tell us if you need it |

## 11. Error codes

| code | HTTP | where | what to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `validation_error` | 422 | anywhere | show `details[].message` under each `field` |
| `unauthorized` | 401 | anywhere | refresh (§4), retry once; if it fails again, sign out |
| `invalid_credentials` | 401 | login | "Wrong email or password" |
| `invalid_refresh_token` | 401 | refresh | sign out, go to the sign-in screen |
| `rate_limited` | 429 | login | "Too many attempts, try again in N s" (`details.retry_after`) |
| `account_suspended` | 403 | login, anywhere | "This account is suspended, contact support"; sign out |
| `forbidden` | 403 | anywhere | the role can't do this: hide the action; re-fetch `/me` |
| `owner_protected` | 403 | team | the owner can't be changed or removed |
| `self_protected` | 403 | team | you can't change your own role or remove yourself |
| `wrong_password` | 400 | change password | "Current password is wrong" |
| `email_taken` | 409 | register, team | "An account with this email already exists" |
| `not_found` | 404 | anywhere | gone, or never existed: pop the screen and refresh the list |
| `camera_limit_reached` | 409 | add camera | "Your plan allows N cameras" (`details.limit`) |
| `probe_failed` | 422 | add / edit pull camera | show the text for `details.reason` (§5) |
| `not_push_camera` | 422 | rotate key | only push cameras have a key |
| `invalid_cursor` | 400 | events | drop the cursor, reload from the first page |
| `invalid_range` | 422 | stats | since must be before until, at most 31 days apart |
| `media_link_expired` | 403 | image URLs | re-fetch the event for fresh URLs |

An unknown `code`: show a generic "Something went wrong" and log the code with the HTTP status.

## 12. Team screen (admins)

```
GET    /api/v1/users                → [user, ...]                                  users.read
POST   /api/v1/users                {"email", "full_name", "role", "password"}     users.write
PATCH  /api/v1/users/{id}           {"full_name"?, "role"?, "is_active"?}          users.write
DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}           → 204                                          users.write
```

`role` is `admin`, `operator` or `viewer` (`owner` can't be assigned). For now
the admin sets an initial password and passes it on; email invites are
Planned. Deactivating (`is_active: false`) signs the user out at once.

## 13. Things to keep out of the app

- No camera URLs, stream keys or agent tokens in logs, analytics or crash
  reports. They are credentials to someone's CCTV.
- Faces are personal data (biometrics). Don't save crops or frames to the
  gallery or to shared storage; keep the image cache in the app's private
  cache directory. Don't send them to any third-party service.
- Turn on `FLAG_SECURE` on Android, and blur the app-switcher snapshot on
  iOS, for the event screens. This is a reasonable default; confirm with us
  if it gets in the way.

## 14. Questions

Backend: Talgat Islamgozhayev. When the API doesn't do what a screen needs,
ask before working around it. Most changes on our side are small, and a
workaround in the app tends to stay forever.
